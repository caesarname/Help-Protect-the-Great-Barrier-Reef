### important note1: 
I make some change after the demo submission, which including fix the f2 score calculation bug and combine all the python file into one jupyter notebook file called "HOG_SVM.ipynb" since it is hard to depoly the enviroment on other machine. So please use the HOG_SVM.ipynb to do the grading if it is possible.

### important note2: 
If you want to test with python files, please use x64 version instead x32 version python when running this code,x32 will lead limit memory usage

### important note3: 
If you want to test with python files, try to allocate as much as possible RAM (or virtual memory) to pycharm and it`s location disk

### important note4: 
Model from pycharm and colab are not in the same format. Please only use pycharm produced model on pycharm, and vice versa.
